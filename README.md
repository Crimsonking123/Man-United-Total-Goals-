# Man-United-Total-Goals-
This repository scrapes squad data for each year on transfermarkt and uses it to plot a moving bar chart for the goal progress of each United player ever.

The script can be easily repurposed to scrape transfermarket data for other clubs and specific players with a basic understanding of Python. I felt a need to keep track of the total goals data for my favorite club and all its players and how it has changed over time. The moving bar chart displays the top 20 bars but can be changed with your own dataframe
